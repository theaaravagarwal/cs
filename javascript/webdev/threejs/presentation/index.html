        <div class="slide">
            <p class="text">In his article "Student Loans Are Exploitation in Disguise," Fergus Hodgson argues that the student loan system unfairly traps young people in debt, creating long-term financial burdens with limited rewards. Through a mix of credible sources, real-world examples, and strong financial reasoning, Hodgson sheds light on how the system exploits students, urging readers to question the fairness of this debt cycle. His argument isn't just based on facts and figures but appeals to both our emotions and logic, making it hard to ignore his call for change.</p>

        <div class="slide">
            <p class="text">First, let's talk about ethos. Hodgson builds credibility by referencing reliable data, studies, and real-world policies. By grounding his argument in recognized economic research, he positions himself as not just someone with an opinion but as someone who's well-informed about the financial and policy-driven realities of student debt. This ethos builds a trusty bridge with readers, showing he's got a solid foundation for his claims and isn't just making sweeping statements. When he references government policies and how they directly lead to rising student debt, he's essentially telling us, "I've done the research, and I know what I'm talking about."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p class="text">Then there's pathos, the emotional appeal. Hodgson uses language that hits home, with phrases like "trapped in debt" and "burdensome loans" to really underscore the emotional weight of debt. This wording is designed to make readers feel the stress, frustration, and pressure many students feel. It's not just a logical issue; it's a very human one. By painting this vivid emotional picture, Hodgson makes it easier for readers to feel empathy for those struggling under heavy debt loads, making them more likely to support his call for change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p class="text">Finally, logos, logic and reasoning. Hodgson uses logical arguments to outline why student loans are exploitative, emphasizing that their structure keeps students in debt for decades, unlike other forms of credit that have clearer repayment paths. He examines how tuition keeps increasing while wages for graduates stay relatively low, a system that just doesn't add up. By breaking down the issue in logical steps, he shows that, from a purely rational standpoint, the current loan system is broken. This logos appeal supports his argument with undeniable facts, making it difficult for readers to argue against his point.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p class="text">So, through strong ethos, pathos, and logos, Hodgson doesn't just make a case against student loans, he builds a compelling, multidimensional argument that's hard to ignore. His approach invites readers not only to understand the issue intellectually but also to feel its impact emotionally and to see the logic in calling for change.</p>
